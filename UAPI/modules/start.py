# The reload() Function
# When the module is imported into a script, the code in the top-level portion of a module is executed only once.
# Therefore, if you want to reexecute the top-level code in a module, you can use the reload() function. The reload() function imports a previously imported module again. The syntax of the reload() function is this âˆ’
# reload(module_name)
